**Project-2 Description**

We are going to build a web application to tracks your activity as a helper at WeLearnJS Slack Group, each member who received help from any member, would need to tweet about it to the world, that is the way to say "Thank you”. Tweet should contain a member-helper and a special hashtag #welearnjs. After that Member-helper and member-suggester will appear on a google map, taking their geo-location into account. Each member will have 2 dots (circular diagrams) displaying certain activity:

 - First dot displaying amount of overall help by that user on a projects, will grow in size with each mention
 - Second dot displaying amount of suggested or @mentioned helpers. That way members will have a purpose to tweet

*Simple example*

*Example of a tweet:*
 - Oleg:  @Imanuel helped me on a project-1 at  #welearnjs

**What data is needed from every tweet?**
* @nickname of a person who tweeted
* @nickname of a person who helped
* The welearnjs hashtag to filter out needed tweets #welearnjs

It will be location based so our primary interface will consist of a map showing the location of the
people who suggested somebody as a helper and helpers themselves. Approximate Mockup of data taken from Twitter and projected onto a google map.

**Collaboration process**

* We would use ( https://trello.com/ ), so each team would see what needs to be done.
* We divide project onto parts and every group will accomplish its (self chosen) tasks in weekly sprints.
* Every team will have it’s leader, responsible to follow what needs to be done.
* Every day, a team leader should make a daily check-up of what's being done
* By the end of the week(sunday), teams should push it’s work to github, and we will discuss what's done on a arranged meetup (to decide)
* Teams can chat with each other and help with ongoing work
